    "# Regression Analysis using Linear Algebra and Numpy - Code Along \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, you have learned that in statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between data entities (variables). Linear regression is an important predictive analytical tool is considered routine analysis in the data scientist's toolbox. Here, you'll try and develop a basic intuition for regression from a linear algebra perspective using vectors and matrices operations. This lesson covers least-squares regression with matrix algebra without digging deep into the geometric dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "[You can find a deeper mathematical and geometric explanation of the topic here](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf). In this lesson, we'll try to keep things more data-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the role of linear algebra towards regression modeling\n",
    "* Apply linear algebra to fit a function to data, describing linear mappings between input and output variables\n",
    "* Develop simple linear algebraic models for simple and multivariate regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you know that the purpose of the regression process is to fit a mathematical model to a set of observed points, in order to later use that model for predicting new values e.g. predicting sales, based on historical sales figures, predicting house prices based on different features of the house, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a very simple toy example to understand how this works with linear algebra. Say you are collecting data on total number of sales per day for some business. Imagine you've got three data points in the format: \n",
    "\n",
    "(day, total number of sales(in hundreds)) \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1, 1) , (2, 2) , (3, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plot these points on a scatter plot with day (x-axis) vs. sales figures (y-axis), this is what we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.array([1,2,3])\n",
    "y = np.array([1,2,2])\n",
    "               \n",
    "plt.plot(x, y, 'o')\n",
